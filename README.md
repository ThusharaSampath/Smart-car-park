# Smart-car-park
IoT-based smart car park with security system prototype.

This system consists of a mobile app, hosted NodeRED server, Sensor Modules, Buzzer Module and Gate. All of these are connected together with an MQTT-based IoT network. 
NodeRED server act as a central gateway of the application.

We used the ESP8266 module as the CPU of sensor nodes. Arduino is used to program microprocessors. We implement a Wi-FI mesh network between nodes.
